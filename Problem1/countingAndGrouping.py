"""
A catering company has hired you to help with organizing and preparing customer's orders. 
You are given a list of each customer's desired items, and must write a program that will 
count the number of each items needed for the chefs to prepare. 
The items that a customer can order are: salad, hamburger, and water.

Write a function called item_order that takes as input a string named order. The string contains
only words for the items the customer can order separated by one space. 
The function returns a string that counts the number of each item and consolidates them in the following order: 
salad:[# salad] hamburger:[# hambruger] water:[# water]

If an order does not contain an item, then the count for that item is 0. 
Notice that each item is formatted as [name of the item][a colon symbol][count of the item] 
and all item groups are separated by a space.

For example:

    If order = "salad water hamburger salad hamburger" then the function returns "salad:2 hamburger:2 water:1"
    If order = "hamburger water hamburger" then the function returns "salad:0 hamburger:2 water:1"
"""

def item_order(order):
    saladnumber = order.count('salad')
    hamburgernumber = order.count('hamburger')
    waternumber = order.count('water')
    return ('salad:'+str(saladnumber)+' hamburger:'+str(hamburgernumber)+' water:'+str(waternumber))
